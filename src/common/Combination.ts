        // these k-sized sets would be the desired result. However, as we
        // represent sets with lists, we need to take duplicates into
        // account. To avoid producing duplicates and also unnecessary
        // computing, we use the following approach: each element i
        // divides the list into three: the preceding elements, the
        // current element i, and the subsequent elements. For the first
        // element, the list of preceding elements is empty. For element i,
        // we compute the (k-1)-computations of the subsequent elements,
        // join each with the element i, and store the joined to the set of
        // computed k-combinations. We do not need to take the preceding
        // elements into account, because they have already been the i:th
        // element so they are already computed and stored. When the length
        // of the subsequent list drops below (k-1), we cannot find any
        // (k-1)-combs, hence the upper limit for the iteration:
        combs = [];
